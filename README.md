# I WANT TO DEFINE POSIBILITY OF CARD TO SWITCH BETWEEN LISTS

## I NEED TO CREATE MoveCard COMPONENT

THIS COMPONENT NEEDS

- IDS OF EVERY LIST

- ID OF CURRENT LIST CARD IS IN

- CARD ID

EVERYTHING ELSE I'LL GET WHILE DEVELOPING

## THEN I NEED TO CREATE MoveCardContainer, (HIGHER ORDER COMPONENT THAT WILL PROVIDE THROUG PROPS EVERYTHING MoveCard NEEDS)

## YOU NEED TO NEST CONTAINER INSIDE Card COMPONENT

## AND THEN I NEED TO HANDLE CORRESPONDING ACTION INSIDE REDUCERS
