# CARD REMOVAL WITH omit FROM lodash/fp

****

THIS BRANCH COMES AFTER BRANCH, WHERE I DEFINED REMOVAL OF THE CARD

****

## IN THIS BRANCH I'LL USE `/lodash/fp/omit`

SO YOU NEED TO USE MENTIONED FUNCTION IN cards-reducer, WHERE YOU DEFINED OMITION (NEW OBJECT WITH OMITED SPECIFIED OBJECT INSIDE) OF ENTITY OBJECT

IF YOU FORGOT, YOU NEED TO OMIT:

- `cards.entities[cardId]` OBJECT (YOU ARE DOING THAT INSIDE card-reducer)

## omit IS JUST OPOSITE OF set

ALSO omit CALL CAN BE USED AS AN ARGUMENT INSIDE pipe METHOD

BUT PAY ATTENTION, YOU NEED TO DEFINE STRINGIFIED PATH FOR omit

FOR EXAMPLE  ``entities.${cardId}`` (TEMPLATE STRING WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL)

## TAKE A LOOK AT `src/reducers/cards-reducer.js` TO SEE HOV I IMPLEMENTED omit
