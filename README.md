# CARD REMOVAL

****

THIS BRANCH COMES AFTER BRANCHES WHERE I IMPLEMENTED `lodash/fp`S set and pipe

****

AND CARD REMOVAL IN THIS BRANCH IS DEFINED WITHOUT USING ANY lodash METHODS

CHECK OTHER BRANCHES TO SEE REFACTORING WITH omit get METHODS OF fp FROM lodash

## DEFINING REMOVE CARD COMPONENT

CORRESPONDING REACT ELEMENT NEEDS TO BE NESTED INSIDE Card

REQUIRED STUFF ARE JUST listId AND cardId (THAT'S ENOUGH TO REMOVE CARD FROM THE LIST)

## FOR THIS I DEFINED RemoveCard COMPONENT AND RemoveCardContainer

## AND IN BOTH REDUCERS, `REMOVE_CARD` ACTION IS HANDLED
