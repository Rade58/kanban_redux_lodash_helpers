# I WANT TO REFACTOR, ACTION CREATORS

BY MENTIONED; I MEAN I WANT TO

- HARDCODE ACTION TYPE NAMES, IN SEPARATE FAILES AND USE (IMPORT) THEIR REFERENCES, WHERE I NEED THEM (LIMITING POSSIBLE MISTEKES BY DOING THIS) (ONCE AGAIN I NEED TO EMPHESISE THAT IF YOU HANDLE ACTION OF TYPE YOU MISTAKEN, NO ERROR WILL BE THROWN AND YOU WON'Y KNOW WHAT IS WRONG)

- I NEED TO REFACTOR mapDispatchToProps FUNCTIONS WHERE I'LL ALSO IMPORT SOME REUSABLE CODE

## IT IS BETTER THAT I DON'T WRITE TO MUCH INFO; INSTEAD OF THAT I'LL REFERENCE IN HERE WHERE AND WHAT CHANGES I DID MAKE

START WITH EASIEST THING

### :one: CREATING `home/actions` FOLDER AND CREATING `card-actions.js` AND `list-actions.js` INSIDE

- mkdir SRC/actions

- touch src/actions/{list,card}-actions.js

### :two: INSIDE CREATED FILES CREATE ACTION TYPES VARIABLES THAT HOLDS ACTION TYPES CORRESSPONDING TO LISTS OR CARDS

- code src/actions/card-actions.js

FOR NOW IN THIS PROJECT I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING WITH LISTS (JUST WITH CARDS BUT NOTHING WILL STOP ME SOME TIME LATER TO IMPLEMENT FOR EXAMPLE DELETING LISTS POSIBILITY)

### :three: INSIDE `src/actions/card-actions.js` YOU WILL NOW DEFINE REUSABLE FUNCTIONS

THESE FUNCTIONS SHOULD OUTPUT OBJECT WITH

- **payload** PROPERTY (OBJECT)

- **type** VALUE (REFERENE OF CORRESSPONDING ACTION TYPE)

HINT:

**JUST GO INSIDE EVERY mapDispatchToProps** CORESPONDING TO MANIPULATION WITH CARDS (I THINK OF ANY CONTAINER THAT DISPATCHES ACTIONS THROUGH mapDispatchToProps)

- CUT ANY FUNCTION

- PAST IT TO src/actions/card-actions.js

- EXPORT THESE FUNCTIONS WITH WIRED IN REFERENCES OF ACTION TYPES

### :four: ALL OF THE FUNCTIONS ARE DOING DISPATCHING; IN THEIR SCOPES IS USED dispatch FUNCTION (ARGUMENT OF mapDispatchToProps); I WILL REMOVE THAT AND INSTEAD OF dispatch CALL WITH OBJECT, THESE FUNCTIONS ARE GOING TO RETURN THAT OBJECT

LIKE I SAID *mapDispatchToProps* **DOES NOT NEED TO BE A FUNCTION, IT CAN BE JUST AN OBJECT**; AND I'LL GET TO THAT, BUT YOU WILL SEE THAT IN CODE, NO NEED FOR WIDE EXPLANATIONS

SO dispatch WILL BE CALLED UNDER THE HOOD AND I DON'T NEED TO SHOW HIM

## :five: IMPORT ALL ACTION FUNCTIONS FROM `src/actions/card-actions.js` AND USE THEM AS A PROPERTY OF EVERY CORRESPONDING mapDispatchToProps (THAT IS NOW OBJECT AND NOT A FUNCTION, LIKE I CHANGE IT)
